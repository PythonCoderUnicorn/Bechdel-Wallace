# Bechdel-Wallace Test of Star Trek DS9 

This data is testing if the episodes per season of the TV show Star Trek DS9 pass or fail the **Bechdel-Wallace** test. For more information check the *Bechdel-test.md*  file. Simple criteria for the test to end in a pass is the following:

## Criteria : 

1. must have 2+ named women 
2. named women talk to each other
3. topic of discussion is not a man/ men including regarding relationship(s)


## Notes for DS9
* Null indicates that 1 female was present in a scene with males or not in the scene at all.
* Jadzia Dax was so frequently the only female in scenes filled with males due to her being the only female that leaves the station on a regular basis, later episodes Kira Nerys does as well
* If an episode has both a fail and a pass, the longer conversation determines the total outcome
* Out of all Star Trek writers for shows TOS, TNG, DS9 and VOY, 66 are female and 302 are male. The female writers in total make up 21.85% of all Star Trek writers. 
* DS9 Female main characters: Kira Nerys, Jadzia Dax, Ezri Dax, Keiko, Kai Winn, Leeta, Female Founder

## Linear Regression 
A linear regression model was conducted to see if there was any affect a Director or Writer's gender had on if it passed or failed the Bechdel-Wallace test.

```
  Call:
  lm(formula = Bechdel ~ Director_Gender + Writer_Gender + Season, 
      data = ds9)
  
  Residuals:
      Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
  -0.1514 -0.1287 -0.1233 -0.1178  0.9117

```

As you can see that there is no statistically signifant affect of either writer or director's gender has on if an episode passes the Bechdel-Wallace test.
